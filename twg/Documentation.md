# 1. Project Vision
- ## Objective
The wholesale group is RL Liquidators' wholesaling division that will provide freight to our existing network of locations and dealers and wholesaling to other companies. The objective is to create a system that will allow The Wholesale Group to create and manage shipments while assigning those shipments in real-time to customers.  This function should be asynchronous in that the user will see the most up-to-date information at all times.  The architecture needs to be scalable to support many thousands of users and millions of orders. The system will include a homepage, authentication system, administrative dashboard, customer dashboard, login, logout, register, contact, and orders page. The system will also communicate to the necessary parties via email when sales orders are created, changes to shipments are made, and received orders. 

- ## Suppositions & Dependencies
From deployment, the application will be developed in a manner that allows the web application to scale as the company scales. The following decisions regarding the software architecture assume that the application will need to handle high-volumes of traffic.

# 2. Non-functional requirement
- ## Appearance & Design
 
There will be 3 views depending on the role. The home page, contact page, and orders page will include images as well as the content. The login, register, and dashboard page will be minimal as far as content and images go. The ideal color scheme will be greyish black with white or off-white text. The order process needs to be simple for customers and salespeople to generate and modify orders. 

Upon registration, the customer should go through an approval process on the admin side before placing orders. This will ensure that the customers are properly vetted before being able to place orders.  Sales should have the ability to create customers and place orders on their behalf.

- ## System Roles

There will be 3 roles in the system.

* Super Admin
* Admin
* User

 

Super Admins will be able to add or remove users, generate orders and view all user account information. 

Admins will have the ability to add users, generate orders and view customer account information. 

Users will be able to view their own account information, generate orders, and view their open transactions in their dashboard.

# 3. Software Architecture 
- ## Technology Stack

* ## Notion 
Notion is an all-in-one workspace where you can write, plan, collaborate and get organized. It allows you to take notes, add tasks, manage projects & more.
* ## Bitbucket & Github
Bitbucket and Github are both Git repository management solutions that allow teams to manage git repositories, collaborate on your source code and manage branches to bring in changes made within the team. 
* ## Figma
Figma is a browser-based design application with excellent design, prototyping, and code-generation tools. It allows multiple users to collaborate at the same time to achieve the ultimate design. 

* ## React
React is an open-source, front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. It allows you to organize your code into small and isolated pieces of code called “components” that can be used throughout the application.

* ## Django
Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables the rapid development of secure and maintainable websites.

* ## Heroku
Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) that developers can use to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps.
